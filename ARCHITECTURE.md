# Ultra-Fast Lexical Indexer Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The Ultra-Fast Lexical Indexer is designed with **NO EMBEDDINGS** for maximum speed and simplicity. The architecture is built around five core principles:

1. **Pure Lexical**: No embeddings, no models, just fast text processing
2. **TF-IDF Scoring**: Advanced relevance scoring without neural networks
3. **Instant Startup**: No model loading delays - ready immediately
4. **Minimal Storage**: Compact indices instead of heavy embedding vectors
5. **Lightning Performance**: Sub-second search with optimized data structures
6. **Absolute Path Support**: Always provides complete file paths for easy navigation in large projects
